<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Hi. I'm Phil.</h3>
<p>
I'm officially a computer scientist (BCompSc form Université de Montréal), but my actual job could be called software engineer, 
software developer, programmer or any title related to solving problems with computer. The most important thing is that I find 
solutions to problems to make other people life easier. That's it!
