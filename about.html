<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Hi. I'm Phil.</h3>
<p>
I'm officially a computer scientist (BCompSc form Université de Montréal), but my actual job could 
be call software engineer, software developer, programmer or any title related to solving problem with a computer. 
The most important thing is that I find solution to problems to make other people life easier. That's it!
