Here is the first scalator release! It provides a very basic MVC framework that provides: 
<ul>
<li>Direct mapping of URL => controller class.</li>
<li>Templating by extending controller class.</li>
<li>Three types of view like scalate, redirection and error.</li>
<li>Use the default tomcat error page or you can render a scalate view with a custom error page.</li>
</ul>
