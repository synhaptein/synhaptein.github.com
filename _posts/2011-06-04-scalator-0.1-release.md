Here is the first scalator release! It provides a very basic MVC framework that provides:

* Direct mapping of URL => controller class.
* Templating by extending controller class.
* Three types of view like scalate, redirection and error.
* Use the default tomcat error page or you can render a scalate view with a custom error page.
