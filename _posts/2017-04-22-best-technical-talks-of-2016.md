A year ago, I started a new job after a year working remotely, meaning back to commuting! For me commuting do not only have down sides, I found an effective way to make use of this time by watching between 5 and 10 conferences a week from technical talk like [Scaling Server Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaOa-Dsbb4o) by Dave Watson explaining modifications to the linux kernel at Facebook to a less technical part of the spectrum like [Agile is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M) by Dave Thomas and passing by more fundamental subjects like [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qBHf8DrWR8) by John Hughes.

Without further ado, from the ~400 talks I watched during the last year, here is my top 10!
