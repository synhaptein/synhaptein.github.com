For week 18, I have a pretty small selection of talks on the myth of the genius programmer, functional programming and adversarial machine learning.

### The Myth of the Genius Programmer

Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman explain how always living a bit out of your comfort zone will help you to become better. Be a small fish in a big pond and learn from the big one. Not a very technical talk, but definitely a must to me !

### Evolving Functional Programming Languages

Erik Osheim explains how sometimes the encoding of a new concept in a language (i.e. typeclass in scala) using existing language is sometime better than relying on macro or compiler plugins to achieve the same thing. Pretty interesting stuff for people into functional programming !

### A Friendly Introduction to Adversarial Machine Learning

Evan Wright approaches the subject with a slightly different angle by highlighting the fact that ML models are subject to exploits and bad guys are also using ML. It brings the question "What kind of security do you want on self-driving cars has a driver or someone nearby ?".
