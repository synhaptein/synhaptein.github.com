Here is the first kaliya release! You can read the <a class="readmore" href="/kaliya/gettingstarted.html">Getting Started</a> section
to get the instructions for testing it. It provides two demos: reverseIndexer and md5cracker. For the moment, it reaches
the goal of the "proof-of-concept" which is what I wanted about this project. Maybe I'll add some features in the future, but
not in a near future.
