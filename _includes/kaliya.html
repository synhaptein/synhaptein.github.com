If you ever want to solve big problems using browser-based nodes, kaliya is the solution! However, it's
more a toy (proof-of-concept) than a usable piece of software!

Kaliya is a framework that uses the mapreduce concept to run job in parallel. It's 
based on scalator for the web interface. It uses a modified version of jSocket to
connect workers to kaliya server using flash socket. At this time, it runs a reverse 
indexing algorithm to demo the framework.
